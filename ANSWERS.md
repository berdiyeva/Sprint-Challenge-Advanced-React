- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

React Lifecycle methods can be used in class components which is tent to implement the logic and state.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

componentDidMount() - is called after a component is added to the DOM and when the setState/state is getiing updates,
componentDidUpdate() - called after every setState (after render) and updating the DOM in response to props or state changes,
componentWillUnmount() - caled before a component is removed, good place to do any cleanup actions.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

custom hook will let to reuse the stateful logic and let write less code, make apps more dynamic etc.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

so that our apps will be safer and better, to reduce the regression, and by testing many bugs can be fixed or eliminated.
